This is a basic chess game I created for my high school project using Visual Basic (language we were using at the time). 
It was my first decently sized project which made use of a decent amount of Object Orientated Programming (for the individual chess pieces, board locations and players) and utilised
a local web server which stored player's details (forename, surname, age, username, password) and statistics (games played, won, lost, win rate, etc).

Given that I spent a month creating this it's a bit rough around the edges and inefficient in parts. I had to cut out a couple of features (checkmate, AI controlling pieces, AI levels etc)
due to time constraints.

If anyone has any recommendations on how to improve efficiency of parts of the program, shoot me a message on discord.
